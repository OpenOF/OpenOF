OpenOF: Framework for Sparse Non-linear Least Squares Optimization on a GPU
===================================================
Version 0.1

Hardware requirements:
------------------------------------------

- Nvidia GPU with compute capability >= 2.0

Software requirements:
------------------------------------------

The framework was tested using Ubuntu 12.04, 64 bit and libraries with the following version number.
- CUDA 5
- Python 2.7
- sympy 0.7.1  It is recommended to use this version as the sympy.cse function in version 0.7.2 does not work for some expression (http://www.mail-archive.com/sympy@googlegroups.com/msg15986.html).
- Thrust 1.6
- CUSP 0.3
- numpy 1.6.1

Getting started:
------------------------------------------

OpenOF comes with two examples, similarity transformation and bundle adjustement. To get started we recommend locking in the simpler model of the similarity transformation. To get the similarity transformation example running you need to do the following steps.
- Move to OpenOF folder

----------------------
> $ cd Example
> 
> $ python similarityTransform.py
> 
> $ cd ..
>
> $ cmake .
>
> $ make

---------------------

A C++ library as well as a Python library was created.

An example how to use the Python library can be found under ./Example
To run the Example proceed as follows:

------------
> $ cd Example
> 
> $ python runSimilarityTranformObj.py

------------

or

------------
> $ python runSimilarityTranform.py

------------

Trouble Shooting:
------------------------------------------


In case you have version 0.7.2 of sympy you can downgrade with the following command:

------------
>
> $ sudo pip install sympy==0.7.1

------------
Cuda 5 does not come with the Thrust 1.6, please exchange the thrust version usually under /usr/local/cuda/include/thrust
